# Synthetic-Defect-Creation

One of the major challenge faced today is the lack of sufficient data on defects, especially for manufacturing parts. These defects are random and unpredictable, varying in orientation, magnitude or place of defect. Hence it is necessary to create datasets that can replicate the randomness of real world defects, particularly in the manufactruing sector. Many of the defect detection AI models require huge amount of datasets to train and GAN models require a huge dataset to train its generator and discriminator model in order produce accurate results. For this reason a python script has been developed that can create as many 3D defected point cloud files as determined by the user once the algorithm is provided with the ideal 3D point cloud.
